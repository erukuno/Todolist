## Overview

This is a simple todo list app developed by me as a project in bid to an assesment test by skye8. The app allows users to add tasks to a list, edit existing tasks, and delete tasks. It provides a clean and intuitive user interface for managing tasks efficiently.

## Features

- Add tasks: Users can add new tasks to the todo list by entering the task description and clicking the "Add Task" button.
- Mark tasks as completed: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking on a checkbox or a designated area in the task item.
- Edit tasks: Users can edit existing tasks by clicking on the task text, making changes, and saving the updated task.
- Delete tasks: Users can delete tasks from the todo list by clicking on a delete button associated with each task item.

## Approach

The development of this todo list app followed a simple and iterative approach:

1. **Planning**: Defined the basic features and functionality of the app, including adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, editing tasks, and deleting tasks.
2. **Design**: Designed the user interface using HTML and CSS to create a clean and user-friendly layout.
3. **Implementation**: Implemented the core functionality of the app using React.js to manage the state of tasks and handle user interactions.
4. **Testing**: Conducted thorough testing to ensure the app functions as expected across different browsers and devices.
5. **Refinement**: Made improvements based on user feedback and further testing to enhance the app's usability and performance.

## Challenges

While developing the todo list app, I encountered several challenges, including:

- Managing state: Implementing state management in React.js to handle task data and user interactions effectively.
- Marking the completed tasks is not fully realized
- implementing the design especially the color codes I had to source them through a third-party.
- Handling user interactions: Implementing event handling and user interactions to allow users to add, edit, complete, and delete tasks effortlessly.
- Within the allocated timeline I was unable to host, with more time I belive I can finish it
